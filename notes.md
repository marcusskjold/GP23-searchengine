## Things to remember from the assignment description

> If a web page entry contains less than two lines after the “*PAGE” line, i.e., it has either no title or no words, the entry should be omitted. (We have to assume that the entry for this web page is erroneous.)

**General recipe to answer a query**

1. Check the query. (“Does the query make sense?”)
2. Retrieve the list of web pages that match the query.
3. Rank the list of matching web pages according to their importance with regard to the query.
4. Return the list of ranked web pages.


## Questions for Poul:
1. Look at our class diagram
2. How are we doing?
